Website Redesign Challenge

Introduction:
Welcome, students! In this exciting team activity, you'll have the opportunity to showcase your HTML and CSS skills while working collaboratively with your peers. The goal is to redesign a simple website, focusing on design principles, user experience, and creativity. Let's dive in!

1. Briefing:
You will be provided with a basic website that is in need of a makeover. Your task is to redesign this website using HTML and CSS. Remember, the emphasis is on creating an engaging and visually appealing user experience.

2. Team Formation:
You will be divided into teams of 3-4 members each. Try to ensure diversity within your team, with members having different skills such as HTML, CSS, and design. This will help you leverage each other's strengths effectively.

3. Brainstorming:
Take some time to brainstorm ideas for the redesign. Discuss layout, color scheme, typography, and any additional features you want to incorporate. Encourage everyone to contribute their ideas and be open to experimentation.

4. Design and Development:
Now it's time to bring your ideas to life! Start implementing your redesign using HTML and CSS. Collaborate closely with your team members, assign tasks based on each member's strengths, and communicate effectively throughout the process.

5. Peer Review:
With about 10-15 minutes left, each team will present their redesigned website to the class. After each presentation, there will be an opportunity for constructive feedback from both peers and the instructor. Take this opportunity to learn from each other and improve your skills.

6. Winner Announcement:
Finally, the winning team will be announced based on criteria such as creativity, functionality, and adherence to design principles. There may even be a small prize for the winners to make it more exciting!
